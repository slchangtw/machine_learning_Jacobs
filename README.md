# Machine Learning at Jacobs (Spring 2018)

The Machine Learning at Jacobs University covered fundamental concepts in the field of machine learning, and the teaching materials can be found at the [link](http://minds.jacobs-university.de/teaching/courses/t2019ml/). In the class of 2018 there were four mini-projects, in which students were asked to implement various machine learning alrorithms from scratch for a digit recognition task. Thus, this repository contains the code, results and the reports.
